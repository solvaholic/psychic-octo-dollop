# Copilot Instructions for Aratus

## About This Project
Aratus analyzes data patterns and relationships. We prioritize clarity in code and documentation.

## Code Standards
- **Node.js ecosystem** - Use npm scripts, CommonJS or ES modules (check existing patterns first)
- **Readability first** - Clear variable names, minimal nesting, obvious data flow
- **Comments only when needed** - Explain *why* something works, not what it does
- **Test coverage** - Run existing tests after changes; don't break baseline functionality

## Communication
- Be direct and concise - no unnecessary explanation
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous
- Suggest alternatives when you spot better approaches
- Point out potential issues early

## When Making Changes
- Make minimal, surgical changes - don't refactor unrelated code
- Follow existing patterns and style in the codebase
- Don't remove or modify working code unless absolutely necessary
- Document changes if they affect the public API

## Feedback & Learning
If you find these instructions aren't working well, just let me know what needs adjusting and I'll update this file.
